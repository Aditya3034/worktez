<p class="title py-2">Board</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    The board page displays the details of a sprint including start and end dates, progress of the sprint, total tasks, completed tasks and a filter to display a specific sprint. The menu button shows active, backlog and deleted sprints. The tasks button redirects the user to the task page.
</p>
<p class="py-2  sub-title">Sprints </p>
<p class="py-2  pb-5 ">
    A sprint is a period of time dedicated to complete a specific set of tasks in the project. The general span of a sprint is 2-4 weeks in agile. The active sprint is the current sprint of the project, the backlog sprint contains the tasks that are for future reference and are on hold for now and the deleted sprint displays all the deleted tasks. The status button has two options: under progress and completed.

<p class="py-2  sub-title">Tasks Page</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    The tasks page displays a list of all the tasks in a sprint for the selected team. Each task contains its priority, task ID, task title, assignee, status, difficulty, and progress in an order. The entire details of a task can be displayed by clicking on a single task, which redirects the user to a task details page. The details of the team members can be sorted based on ascending or descending orders of the headers stated.
</p>
<p class="py-2  sub-title">Story Points</p>
<p class="py-2 ">
    Story points are metric units used to measure the amount of work needed to finish a task or a product backlog item. Based on the number, complexity, and uncertainty of the work, the team gives story points. Story points in Agile are abstract measurements that developers use instead of hours. Points are relative values, so a story with a value of four is twice as hard as a story with a value of two. Story points tell you how much effort a given story (task) will take to resolve.

<p class="py-2">
    My dashboard page displays a user's performance chart that displays the user performance over the range of sprints based on the story points in the completed tasks and the tasks section contains the list of tasks assigned to the user that are yet to be completed.

    Kanban board is an Agile project management tool used to visualise the flow of work, interpret it and maximise the efficiency of the team. The Kanban board contains the tasks categorised according to their status i.e. ice box, ready to start, under progress, and blocked. Each status is displayed as a column of tasks with their respective status. The tasks can be moved from one status column to another to edit their status.
